# Provenance Contract

Anchor: Provenance must name files that were actually read, not files inferred from memory.

Summary: This note separates source discovery from answer writing. It preserves trust by rejecting citations that are not backed by read files.

Fixture controls:
- ordinary

Profile-derived traits:
- Folder and note type are derived from profile-lumina-docs-v0, profile-opencode-docs-v0.
- Link, stale, duplicate, or boundary structure is synthetic and reviewable.

Deterministic review:
- Gold labels can cite the Anchor line and this vault-relative path.
- No raw private note text or provider payload is included.
