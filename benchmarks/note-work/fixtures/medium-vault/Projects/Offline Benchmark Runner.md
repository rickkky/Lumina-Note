# Offline Benchmark Runner

Anchor: The offline runner reads task JSON, runs a system, and writes schema-valid run output.

Summary: The runner is intentionally small. It avoids network calls and keeps reproducibility above model-heavy judging.

Fixture controls:
- ordinary

Profile-derived traits:
- Folder and note type are derived from profile-lumina-docs-v0, profile-opencode-docs-v0.
- Link, stale, duplicate, or boundary structure is synthetic and reviewable.

Deterministic review:
- Gold labels can cite the Anchor line and this vault-relative path.
- No raw private note text or provider payload is included.
